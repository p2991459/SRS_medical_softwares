116,Title:,Scalability
117,Description:,"The microchip used into the Fibercure laser pen is dsPIC33CK256MP508.
Microchip’s dsPIC33CK family of digital signal controllers (DSCs) feature a 100 MHz dsPIC® DSC core with integrated DSP and enhanced on-chip peripherals. These DSCs enable the design of digital power, motor control, advanced sensing and control, high-performance general-purpose and robust applications.
The DSCs feature advanced analog for advanced sensor interfacing designs. Offering real-time deterministic performance, the DSCs enable high-performance control applications. The rich feature set in this family of devices also make this family a very good fit for high-performance general-purpose and robust applications.
The dsPIC33CK product family has many hardware features that help simplify functional safety certifications for ASIL-B and SIL-2 focused automotive and industrial safety-critical applications

The microcontroller used has an internal flash which is used only as program memory: during the life of the product no data is saved and therefore no writing takes place.
As regards the life time it refers to the retention value TRETD (Characteristic Retention). This value is identified by the manufacturer as equal to 20 years in the full range of voltage and temperature use."

All the possible situations and scenarios in which a typical operator can find himself and can interact with the equipment in an intuitive way and without having specific knowledge of his field, particular acumen or dexterity will be taken into consideration. Further considerations have been made in the usability documentation."
