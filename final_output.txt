Endofill Is a low-viscosity, injectable, hydrophilic, light-curable endodontic sealer  

2 OVERALL DESCRIPTION  
2.1 Product Scope  
Fibercure is a dental, cordless, battery-powered laser-based curing lamp. It is an easy-to-use illumination device developed specifically to cure Endofill within the root canal. Fibercure includes a thin optical fiber tip that can easily penetrate into small cavities, ensuring that a focused light beam homogeneously reaches the entirety of structures where light access would be unattainable using current devices. The Fibercure laser pen software will adhere to risk management procedures as outlined in ISO 14971. The risk management process will be integrated throughout the software lifecycle to identify, analyze, evaluate, and mitigate potential risks.

2.2 Intended Use  
This product allows a fast and efficient photopolymerization of Endofill inside root canals. Fibercure is designed for the use of Endofill, with the correct light power, wavelength, and time of use pre-registered.

2.3 User Needs  
The intended users of Fibercure are licensed dental professionals with experience in endodontics. In addition, Fibercure is procured, stored, and prepared for use by trained dental nurses or trained dental assistants. Fibercure is intended to be an easy-to-use dental curing lamp in curing Endofill material within the root canal. This represents a faster and easier method for root canal care compared to current applications in the same clinical application field.

2.4 Assumptions and Dependencies  
Fibercure is dependent on the light-curable material, which is developed in another project (Endofill). Only when both projects are ready, Fibercure can be marketed. The forthcoming development steps, following assumptions are made:  
• The light-curable material (Endofill) will be available on due time.  
• Suitable production facility will be identified.  
• Suitable packaging is available and can be handled by the production facility.  
• The development depends on the results of the planned clinical study in dental settings.  
The device shall be ready for commercial launch by December 2023.

Edge Cases  
If the LED fails to turn green when the device is turned on, the software should alert the user with a specific error message or sound.

ID: FR2 
Title: Activate the protocol n°1  
Description: The user presses once the second button (on the top of the pen), and the LED light turns Blue. Laser output lasts for 10 seconds, then the Blue LED Light turns off.  
Depth: FR1  

Edge Cases  
If the LED fails to turn blue when the protocol is activated, the software should alert the user with a specific error message or sound.

ID: FR3 
Title: Activate the protocol n°2  
Description: The user presses twice the second button (on the top of the pen), and the LED light turns Purple. Laser output lasts for 20 seconds, then the Purple LED Light turns off.  
Depth: FR1 

Edge Cases  
If the LED fails to turn purple when the protocol is activated, the software should alert the user with a specific error message or sound.

ID: FR4 
Title: Turn OFF the device  
Description: To turn OFF the laser pen, the user presses and holds the first button (labeled as ON/OFF button - bottom of the pen) until the green LED disappears.   
Depth: FR1 

Edge Cases  
If the LED fails to turn off when the device is turned off, the software should alert the user with a specific error message or sound.

ID: FR5 
Title: Shutdown time after inactivity  
Description: After not using the laser pen for 5 minutes, the device switches off. 
Depth: FR1 

Battery requirements:  
ID: FR6 
Title: Low battery signal (during READY phase)  
Description: In cases where the battery is running low during READY phase, the user can see the LED indicators of the unit will begin an alternate flash accompanied by an audible signal. 
Depth: FR1  

Edge Cases  
If the low battery signal fails to turn on, the software should alert the user with a specific error message or sound.

ID: FR7 
Title: Need to change the battery  
Description: It will no longer be possible to return to the OPERATE phase until the battery is replaced with a charged one.  
Depth: FR6 

Edge Cases  
If the software fails to recognize that a battery has been replaced and does not return to the OPERATE phase, the software should alert the user with a specific error message or sound.

ID: FR8 
Title: Low battery signal (during OPERATE phase)
