Deficiencies and areas of improvement in the SRS to align with the IEC 62304 standard:
1. The SRS lacks a detailed description of the software architecture, including the software modules, design, and interfaces, which are critical to ensure software reliability and maintainability.
2. The SRS does not provide a comprehensive list of software requirements with clear acceptance criteria, which makes it difficult for the software development team to ensure that the software meets all necessary requirements.
3. The SRS does not include a detailed description of software verification and validation activities that ensure software safety and reliability. This information should be included to align with IEC 62304, which requires a thorough verification and validation process.
4. The SRS should also include a detailed description of the software risk management activities, which are critical to identify and mitigate potential risks associated with software use.
5. The SRS should include more non-functional requirements, such as performance, maintainability, and reliability, to ensure that the software meets necessary quality and safety standards.
