Deficiencies and areas for improvement to align with IEC 62304 standards:

1. Lack of detailed functional requirements: The functional requirements identified in the SRS document are lacking in detail, including edge cases, error handling, and responses to abnormal situations. The software development process should include a more thorough analysis of all possible scenarios and provide clear instructions for error handling and abnormal situations.

2. Incomplete system requirements: The SRS document mentions that the software is embedded into the medical device and is a closed system, but there is no mention of system requirements such as hardware compatibility, OS version, or other system-level constraints. It is important to clearly define these requirements to ensure the software operates within the device's specific constraints.

3. Missing traceability: The SRS document does not provide clear traceability between the functional requirements and the risk management procedures outlined in ISO 14971. It is essential to establish traceability to ensure that the software requirements adequately address the identified risks and potential harm to the patient, operator, and environment.

4. Lack of detail in non-functional requirements: The non-functional requirements section lacks specific details, especially for requirements such as performance, maintainability, supportability, reliability, and cybersecurity. These requirements should be clearly defined and measurable to ensure that the software meets the desired quality attributes.

5. Inadequate security requirements: The SRS document states that the software is not intended to handle sensitive data but does not provide specific security requirements. The software should still adhere to relevant security standards, such as ensuring secure data transmission, protection against unauthorized access, and secure storage of any sensitive data.

6. Insufficient usability evaluation: The document mentions that usability will be evaluated based on the ability to interact with the device, but it does not provide specific usability criteria or methods for evaluation. Usability should be assessed through user testing and evaluation to ensure that the software is intuitive and easy to use for the intended users.

Overall, improvements can be made by providing more detailed and comprehensive requirements, ensuring traceability to risk management procedures, addressing all relevant non-functional requirements, including specific security requirements, and conducting thorough usability evaluations.
