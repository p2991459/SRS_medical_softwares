Deficiencies and areas of improvement: 

1. The SRS lacks a clear section on risk analysis and risk management, which are crucial components of medical device development in accordance with the IEC 62304 standard. A comprehensive risk management plan should be developed and included in the SRS to identify, analyze, evaluate, and mitigate potential risks associated with the Fiber
2. The SRS could benefit from a more detailed description of the system architecture and design. This would provide a clear understanding of the system requirements and how they are met by the software.cure laser pen.


3. The functional requirements listed in the SRS need to be further expanded and updated to include all possible edge cases, error handling, and abnormal situations that may arise during use. This will ensure that the software is robust and reliable in real-life scenarios.

4. The non-functional requirements listed in the SRS need to be more specific and measurable. For example, the performance requirement should specify the maximum acceptable response time and the acceptable level of accuracy.

5. The SRS does not mention any testing or verification procedures to ensure that the software meets the specified requirements. A separate document detailing the validation and verification activities should be included in the project plan.

6. There is no mention of any user feedback or usability testing in the SRS. Including user feedback in the development process could help ensure that the software meets the needs of its intended users and is easy to use. A separate document detailing the usability testing procedures and results should be included in the project plan.
